#Using a worker route and APO on the same request

APO is implemented as a first party worker.  This means that if there is a [worker route](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) defined for the same request as APO, the APO worker will run first and then the worker as defined by the worker route will then run.
Due to this, APO and a worker can both run on the same request.
