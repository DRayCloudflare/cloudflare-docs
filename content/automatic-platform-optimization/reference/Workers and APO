#Using a worker route and APO on the same request
APO is implemented by using Cloudflare First-Party Workers. These First-Party Workers are Cloudflare Workers with special permissions.
If you have a normal cloudflare [worker route](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) as well APO for the same path, the APO worker will run first and then your worker will run after that.  They will both run for the same request.
