title: Cloudflare HTTP response headers
---

import { Render } from "~/components";

Cloudflare passes all HTTP response headers from your origin web server and adds additional headers as specified below.

:::note

Cloudflare may remove HTTP request headers with names considered invalid [according to NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#ignore_invalid_headers) — for example, header names containing a `.` (dot) character.
:::

## CF-RAY

The `CF-ray` header (otherwise known as a [Ray ID](/fundamentals/reference/cloudflare-ray-id/)) is a hashed value that encodes information about the data center and the visitor’s request. For example: `CF-RAY: 230b030023ae2822-SJC`.

## CF-Cache-Status
